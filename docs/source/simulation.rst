Simulating raw data
===================

Check out `this Medium post <https://medium.com/@bezzam/simulating-camera-measurements-through-wave-optics-with-pytorch-support-faf3fa620789>`__
for a detailed explanation of how to simulate raw data of lensless cameras, given a digital image of a scene and point spread function (PSF).

In short, there are several scripts inside the `scripts/sim <https://github.com/LCAV/LenslessPiCam/tree/main/scripts/sim>`__
folder that can be used to simulate raw data. Behind the scenes, code from the `waveprop <https://pypi.org/project/waveprop/>`__
library is used with the following simulation steps:

#. **Prepare object plane**: resize and pad the original image according to the physical dimensions of the setup and camera sensor.
#. **Convolve with PSF**.
#. (Optionally) **downsample**: perhaps you use a higher resolution PSF than your actual camera sensor.
#. **Add noise**: e.g. shot noise to replicate noise at the sensor or Gaussian noise.
#. **Quantize** according to the bit depth of the sensor.

PyTorch support is available to speed up simulation on GPU, and to create Dataset and DataLoader objects for training and testing!
